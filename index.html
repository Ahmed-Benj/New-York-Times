            discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with.

            A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could
            have

            cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable.

      <strong class="text1"> Spirals in the Sky </strong>

      <p class="article">
        Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the

        cosmic microwaves, which were discovered accidentally by Arno
        Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the

        Nobel Prize.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these

        waves. He is one of four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a

        series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole,

        where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The

        others are Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie
        Bock of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of
        Stanford.

        In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave
        radiation was polarized, meaning the light waves had a slight
        preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the
        gravitational waves from inflation. Such waves, squeezing space in
        one direction and stretching it in another as they go by, would
        twist
        the direction of polarization of the microwaves, theorists said. As
        a
        result, maps of the polarization in the sky should have little
        arrows
        going in spirals.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small
        differences in the temperature of the microwaves. The group’s
        telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting
        thermometer.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        “We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they
        spent a year burning up time on a Harvard supercomputer, making
        sure they had things right and worrying that competitors might

        beat them to the breakthrough.

      <strong class="text1"> A Special Time </strong>

      <p class="article">
        The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists
        like
        Dr. Guth, staying up late in his Palo Alto house 35 years ago,
        suspected was a special break point in the
        evolution of the
        universe.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today:
        gravity, electromagnetism, and strong and weak nuclear forces.
        But they have long suspected that those are simply different
        manifestations of a single unified force that ruled the universe in
        its
        earliest, hottest moments.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall
        from grace, like some old folk mythology of gods or brothers
        falling
        out with each other. The laws of physics evolved, with one force
        after another splitting away.
      </p>
      <p class="article">That was where Dr. Guth came in.</p>
      <p class="article">
        Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the
        temperature falls below 32 degrees, until it is disturbed, at which
        point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified
        state
        too long. In that case, space itself would become imbued with a
        mysterious latent energy.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as
        a
        kind of antigravity, and the universe would blow itself up. Since
        it
        was space itself supplying the repulsive force, the more space was
        created, the harder it pushed apart.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size
        at least a trillion trillionfold — from a submicroscopic speck of
        primordial energy to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a
        cosmic
        eye-blink.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary
        particles and radiation. All of normal cosmic history was still
        ahead, resulting in today’s observable universe, a patch of sky and
        stars billions of light-years across. “It’s often said that there is
        no
        such thing as a free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes to say, “but the
        universe
        might be the ultimate free lunch.”
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting
        from Dr. Guth’s original vision suggest that inflation, once
        started,
        is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a comfortable
        homey expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue blowing up,
        spinning off other bubbles endlessly, a concept known as the
        multiverse.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do
        not
        bother asking about going any deeper into the past.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very
        beginning, because inflation erases everything that came before it.
        All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are swept
        away, forever out of our view.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        “If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a Harvard-
        Smithsonian astronomer who was not part of the team, “you wind
        up at inflation.”

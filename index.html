        CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist
        named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford,
        stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the
        world of known physics.
      </p>

      <p class="article">
        He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
        particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he
        discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A
        potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have
        infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive
        force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for
        a prodigiously violent instant.
      </p>

      <p class="article">
        If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the
        heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped
        mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
        irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted
        beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
      </p>

      <p class="article">
        “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and
        drew a double box around it.
      </p>

      <p class="article">
        On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that
        they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis,
        known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
      </p>

      <p class="article">
        Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic
        time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by
        John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
        detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational
        waves — the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when
        it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second
        old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof,
        Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.

        Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many,
        including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
      </p>

      <p class="article">
        If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science
        comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe
        apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and
        space and energy to science and speculation.
      </p>

      <p class="article">
        Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14
        billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies,
        is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent,
        architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe
        there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy
        eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.

      <p class="article">
        In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
        operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators
        on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples
        would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which,
        according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle
        space-time.
      </p>

      <p class="article">
        Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert
        who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”
      </p>

      <p class="article">
        He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending
        a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
      </p>

      <p class="article">
        The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of
        microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture of the
        universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the
        sun.
      </p>

      <p class="article">
        Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as
        Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization,
        reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for
        Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The

          Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft
          <br />
          will report its own findings this year. At least a dozen other teams
          <br />
          are trying similar measurements from balloons, mountaintops and <br />
          space.

          Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the
          <br />
          cosmic microwaves, which were discovered accidentally by Arno <br />
          Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the
          <br />
          Nobel Prize.

          Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these <br>
          waves. He is one of four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a <br> series
          of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole, <br> where
          the thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The <br> others are
          Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie<br> Bock of the
          California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of<br> Stanford.

          In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave<br> radiation 
          was polarized, meaning the light waves had a slight<br> preference to vibrate in
          one direction rather than another.
        </p>
        <p class="article">This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational 
          waves from inflation. Such waves, squeezing space in one direction and stretching it in 
          another as they go by, would twist the direction of polarization of the microwaves, theorists said.
           As a result, maps of the polarization in the sky should have little arrows going in spirals.

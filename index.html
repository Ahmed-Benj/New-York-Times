          CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young <br />
          physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s <br />
          appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and <br />
          equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
        </p>

        <p class="article">
          He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
          <br />
          particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he
          <br />
          discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with.
          <br />
          A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could
          have <br />
          infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a <br />
          repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed
          <br />
          of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
        </p>

        <p class="article">
          If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the
          <br />
          heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, <br />
          warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the <br />
          wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but
          <br />
          would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.

          “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of <br />
          the page and drew a double box around it.
        </p>

        <p class="article">
          On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers <br />
          reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that
          <br />
          his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.

          Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic
          <br />
          time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomer <br />s
          led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for <br />
          Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-
          <br />called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being
          <br />
          wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a
          <br />trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the
          long-sought <br />
          smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his <br />
          colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.

          Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though
          <br />
          many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be
          <br />proved.
        </p>

        <p class="article">
          If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in <br />
          science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing
          <br />the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open
          vast <br />
          realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
        </p>

        <p class="article">
          Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see,<br />
          extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of <br />
          billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger
          cosmos <br />whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable.
          Moreover,<br />
          beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of <br />
          other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta

          In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces <br />

          <p class="article">
            This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the<br />

            in<br />
            one direction and stretching it in another as they go by, would
            twist<br />
            the direction of polarization of the microwaves, theorists said. As

            like<br />
            Dr. Guth, staying up late in his Palo Alto house 35 years ago,<br />
            suspected was a special break point in the<br />
            evolution of the<br />
            universe.

            Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today:<br />
            gravity, electromagnetism, and strong and weak nuclear forces.<br />
            But they have long suspected that those are simply different<br />
            manifestations of a single unified force that ruled the universe in
            its<br />
            earliest, hottest moments.

            As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a

            from grace, like some old folk mythology of gods or brothers
            falling<br />
            out with each other. The laws of physics evolved, with one force<br />
            after another splitting away.

            Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified

            Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as
            a<br />
            kind of antigravity, and the universe would blow itself up. Since
            it<br />
            was space itself supplying the repulsive force, the more space
            was<br />

            ahead, resulting in today’s observable universe, a patch of sky

            stars billions of light-years across. “It’s often said that there is
            no<br />

            started,<br />
            is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a
            comfortable<br />
            homey expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue blowing up,<br />
